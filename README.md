## Design

### User Interface Design
  
* << A wireframe or drawing of the user interface concept along with a short description of the interface. You should have one for each screen in your program. >>
    * For example, if your program has a start screen, game screen, and game over screen, you should include a wireframe / screenshot / drawing of each one and a short description of the components
* << You should also have a screenshot of each screen for your final GUI >>

### Program Design
  
* Non-Standard libraries
    * << You should have a list of any additional libraries or modules used (pygame, request) beyond non-standard python. >>
    * For each additional module you should include
        * url for the module documentation
        * a short description of the module
* Class Interface Design
    * << A simple drawing that shows the class relationships in your code (see below for an example). >>
        * ![class diagram](assets/class_diagram.jpg)
    * This does not need to be overly detailed, but should show how your code fits into the Model/View/Controller paradigm.
* Classes
    * << You should have a list of each of your classes with a description. >>

## Deployment
  
### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install it

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

<<
 A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
