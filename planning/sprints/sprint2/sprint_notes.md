###  User Story

- As a user, I want to see posts my friends have created
- As a user, I want to add captions and pictures to my posts

### Sprint Requirements Attempted

- started the coding for the frontend gui

### Completed Requirements

- implemented the front end gui for the basic structure of the app, the newsfeed page, the create post form, and the user profile page

### Incomplete Requirements

- the create post form is not 100% interactive, so right now you can't add new posts to the newsfeed page

### The summary of the entire project:

Social Media App where users can share their daily activities with friends and gain inspiration of places to travel to from others on their feed.
