## Sprint Planning

### Requirement Target:

Ability to submit a review.

### Planning

- plan the design of the different UI and how they’ll interact
- Implement database 
- Allow user interaction


### Action Items

- Use a design tool to setup UI
- Use python to create interfaces


### Issues and Risks
 
- We make a UI that’s too complex to setup the interface for in our slotted time
- We could have poor structure in our interface, over-complicating our design

### Team Work Assignments
 
- All design UI and interface
- All look into and implement data models
