Application Vision/Goal:
    Social Media App where users can share their daily activities with friends and gain inspiration of places to travel to from others on their feed.

Scope:
    Our app will include a map api and track gps locations. It will have a newsfeed section. It will also give uses a estimated time of activity (how it takes to complete the activity), cost of activity, and distance from activity.
    
Deliverables:
    The user will be able to view the map, newsfeed, reviews of places, and be able to form social circles with friends.

Success Criteria:
    That it works and no bugs. The gps is recording to the proper places, and the friend groups information and locations are limited only to the members with invites to the group.

Assumptions:
    We assume that the user will be interactive with the app by posting and reviewing posts.

Risks:
    Hackers that can gain access to user locations.
    Database becomes too small (not enough space to hold each user's data).

Design / Architectural Review:
    We will follow the Agile Approach.
    Right now we predict that we will need 5 views. One for the interactive map. The second view for the newsfeed. The third view for viewing your friends list, creating groups, and adding new friends. The fourth view for login page & sign out page (just change the text). And the last view for the settings (settings will include the logout button, connect to ig button, etc.)

Test Environment:
    The three of us. We will create our own friend group to ensure the gps works correctly and the images uploads in the right spots.
