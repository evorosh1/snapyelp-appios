## Sprint Review

### SRS Sections Updated

N/A

### User Story

As a client, I want an application that I can deploy on any server running Docker

### Requirement Implemented

**The application shall minimize required dependencies**

In order to minimize dependencies, we will containerize the application with its dependencies. 

Limit the dependency to a system that supports Docker containers.

*Status: completed* 

### Completed Items

- Docker file set up and container works 
- uploaded to github
- Django implemented

### Uncompleted Items

- Implementation of Swift

### The summary of the entire project:

Social Media App where users can share their daily activities with friends and gain inspiration of places to travel to from others on their feed.

## Sprint Planning

### Requirement Target:

Setup interface and get data models working. Start back end mechanisms.

### User Stories:

As a developer, I want to add an interface feature so that the user can view posts showcasing different activities/events.

### Planning

- plan the design of the different interfaces and how they’ll interact. 
- Figure out data models
- Start further back end development

### Action Items

- Use a design tool to setup UI
- Hold a meeting to figure out models
- Use python to create interfaces

### Issues and Risks
 
- We make a UI that’s too complex to setup the interface for in our slotted time
- We could have poor structure in our interface, over-complicating our design

### Team Work Assignments
 
- All design UI and interface
- All look into and implement data models
