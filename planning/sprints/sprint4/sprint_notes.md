## Requirements Flex

5/5 requirement flexes remaining

## Technical Debt

<< Any requirements from the previous sprint that are using a technical flex >>

### Requirement Target

- Newsfeed GUI

### User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to create posts for my newsfeed
- As a user, I want to express my thoughts on a post by adding a comment
- As a user, I want a option to delete a post Iâ€™ve created

### Planning

<< Our team's detailed plan to complete the sprint >>

- need to construct a post data model
- need to create the api endpoints for the following requests:
  - GET: returns a list of all posts created by the user
  - POST: saves each post created by the user
- wire up the frontend guis to access these endpoints

### Action Items

- the post data model needs to have a many-to-one relationship with the user data model

### Issues and Risks

- A user could accidently delete their posts

### Team Work Assignments

Liz - 
Destiny -
Cole - continue to work on backend
