Title: Interactive Map Feature

The Persona:
It's a Friday night and Ron is looking for a place for him and friends to go out to eat. His impatient and too lazy to read through the tons of google reviews on the top bars in his area.


The User Story:
1) As a developer, I want to add a interactive map feature so that the user can view posts showcasing different activities/events going on near their current location.
2) As a developer, I want to create a fun, engaging, and interactive review-like platform so that the user can easily view pictures and reviews/ratings of places near their area.


The Acceptance Requirements:
Having this feature meets the user requirements of needing a quick way to find fun places near their area that they can go to hang out.
