Title: Newsfeed Feature

The Persona:
Brenda is not too tech savy and has difficultly with scrolling and zooming in & out through the map feature. She rather prefers to view the posts from her friends in a newsfeed list rather than a map.


The User Story:
1) As a user, I want to have a newsfeed section so that I can view posts from people within friends list.
2) As a developer, I want to implement a newsfeed feature so that the user can have different alternatives for viewing the posts.
3) As a developer, I want to implement a newsfeed feature so that the user can view videos and other statuses posted by other users.


The Acceptance Requirements:
Having this feature meets the user requirements of needing a easier way to navigate through the different posts.
