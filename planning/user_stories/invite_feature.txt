Title: Invite Feature

The Persona: 
Bob is a very private person and is anxious about letting strangers view his personal posts. He would only like for his friends and family to view his posts.


The User Story:
1) As the developer, I want to create a invite-only kind of feature so that the user can create groups and have other users join their group by sending out invites or by add users manually by username


The Acceptance Requirements:
Having this feature meets the user requirements of needing to create a private group where only the users within that group can view their posts.
